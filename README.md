# k-means
Implements the k-means clustering algoritmn on pixelated images to create images grouped into k clusters of pixel values

# Setup
1. Download the image_utils, k_means, and k_means_main files
2. Run the k_means_main 
3. Enter the filepath to a ppm image saved to your desktop
4. Enter a value for k, the number of color pixel values to group your image into 
5. Enter the name of the file that you want to save the clustered image as. Make sure that the file name ends with ".ppm"

Expected output
For an image with an input value of k, expect the clustered image to contain k distinct color pixel values.
As the value of k increases, you should oberserve that the clustered image more and more closely resembles the original, unclustered image
